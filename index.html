                    My physical goals for this year is to not get up the stair to my aprment without getting winded. What I can do to achive this is contantly go up and down the stairs for practice.
                <p>
                    My emotional goal for this year is not to cry every single day, which I failed already. I don't know how I am going to achieve this, but I will try my hardest to express my feelings.
                <p>
                    My social goal is to have lots of friends. There is no specific number, but the feeling that you have a lot. I think I have achieved this goal.
